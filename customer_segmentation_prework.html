		<p><strong>Description:</strong> Philo offers on-demand Internet TV across mobile and web platforms. Unlike the traditional bundled cable model where viewers get channels and shows they don't want at times that are often inconvenient, Philo lets viewers pick what and when to watch, including live TV and DVR.</p>
		<p>Based in Cambridge, Philo (formerly named Tivli) received $6.3M in Series A funding in July 2013. Their rollout strategy targets students at select US colleges and universities.</p>

		</tr>
		
		<tr>
			<td>College students: they tend to think that traditional cable is old-fashioned because they don't like what's on and they can't rearrange their schedules around shows. A significant percentage of them turn to pirating, but they're nervous about getting caught.</td>	
			<td>They're looking for a cheap, easy way to watch TV on campus that fits with their busy lives and doesn't get them in trouble for pirating.</td>
			<td>Get hundreds of your favorite shows on demand, on whatever device you want--your laptop, iPad, or smartphone--and share what you're watching with your friends on campus.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>University administrators: although they may use Philo's services themselves, their primary value is as gatekeepers with whom deals and university distribution are established. </td>
			<td>They're concerned about giving students an enticing entertainment option, lowering (or not significantly raising) their costs of things like campus bandwidth usage, and avoiding copyright infringement issues with students caught pirating.</td>
			<td>Philo's technology streams video across your campus's existing network, giving students the TV they want without straining your bandwidth--or your budget. And because Philo has already negotiated legal content, you avoid costly and annoying DMCA requests.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Multichannel video programming distributors (MVPDs): traditional cable providers like Comcast, AT&amp;T U-verse, and Verizon FiOS. Although big companies like these have a strong presence in the TV market, they're worried about "cord-cutting" and losing their foothold to consumers who only watch content online. Their cooperation is necessary for Philo's business to succeed, so Philo's strategy has been to engage them as partners and facilitators without too radically treading on them as competitors.</td>
			<td>Increase their marketshare, especially by getting in early with college students who may become loyal, lifelong customers. Appear more innovative and in touch with tech-savvy consumers' wants while maintaining traditional, established distribution models.</td>
			<td>The perfect combination of your network with an innovative on-demand UI makes the most of your existing resources without you expending any effort, making loyal fans out of your college-aged users.</td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
			<td>Online video content providers: this group includes Netflix, HBO, Showtime, and Hulu. Some specialize in content creation, like HBO, while others, like Netflix, primarily make third-party content available but have begun creating their own material (like House of Cards and the new Arrested Development season). As newer entrants to the video market, they embrace technological change like multiple devices and streaming.</td>
			<td>As content creators and rights-holders, they want to get their shows out to the world while keeping down copyright infringement through DRM. They want to strengthen already existing relationships with younger viewers and establish new ones.</td>
			<td>Philo does the hard work of getting your services and your content in front of an eager demographic that will love it (and consume it legally).</td>
